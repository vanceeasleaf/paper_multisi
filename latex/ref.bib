abstract = {The linear dispersion relation in graphene gives rise to a surprising prediction: the resistivity due to isotropic scatterers, such as white-noise disorder or phonons, is independent of carrier density, n. Here we show that electron-acoustic phonon scattering is indeed independent of n, and contributes only 30 Omega to graphene's room-temperature resistivity. At a technologically relevant carrier density of 1 x1012 cm-2, we infer a mean free path for electron-acoustic phonon scattering of {\textgreater}2 microm and an intrinsic mobility limit of 2 x 105 cm2 V-1 s-1. If realized, this mobility would exceed that of InSb, the inorganic semiconductor with the highest known mobility ( approximately 7.7 x 104 cm2 V-1 s-1; ref. 9) and that of semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( approximately 1 x 105 cm2 V-1 s-1; ref. 10). A strongly temperature-dependent resistivity contribution is observed above approximately 200 K (ref. 8); its magnitude, temperature dependence and carrier-density dependence are consistent with extrinsic scattering by surface phonons at the SiO2 substrate and limit the room-temperature mobility to approximately 4 x 104 cm2 V-1 s-1, indicating the importance of substrate choice for graphene devices.},

abstract = {Despite the recent progress on two-dimensional multilayer materials (2DMM) with weak interlayer interactions, the investigation on 2DMM with strong interlayer interactions is far from its sufficiency. Here we report on first-principles calculations that clarify the structural evolution and optoelectronic properties of such a 2DMM, multilayer silicene. With our newly developed global optimization algorithm, we discover the existence of rich dynamically stable multilayer silicene phases, the stability of which is closely related to the extent of sp3 hybridization that can be evaluated by the average bonds and effective bond angles. The stable Si(111) surface structures are obtained when the silicene thickness gets up to four, showing the critical thickness for the structural evolution. We also find that the multilayer silicene with pi-bonded surfaces present outstanding optoelectronic properties for the solar cells and optical fiber communications due to the incorporation of sp2-type bonds in the sp3-type bonds dominated system. This study is helpful to complete the picture of structure and related property evolution of 2DMM with strong interlayer interactions.},

Using a direct application of the Fourier law, we explore the transition to fully diffusive phonon transport with increasing CNT length. For empty CNTs, we find that the CNT length required to obtain fully diffusive phonon transport decreases from 1090 nm for the 0.83-nm-diameter CNT to 510 nm for the 1.36-nm-diameter CNT. The magnitude of the fully diffusive thermal conductivity also decreases monotonically with increasing CNT diameter. We find that the fully diffusive thermal conductivity of water-filled CNTs is 20{\%}–35{\%} lower than that of empty CNTs. By examining the empty and water-filled CNT density of states, we attribute the thermal conductivity reductions to an increase in low-frequency acoustic phonon scattering due to interactions with the water molecules.},

Reliable transistor performance is achieved at room temperature in samples thinner than 7.5 nm, with drain current modulation on the order of 10(5) and well-developed current saturation in the I-V characteristics. The charge-carrier mobility is found to be thickness-dependent, with the highest values up to ∼ 1,000 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) obtained for a thickness of ∼ 10 nm.

The lateral thermal conductivity of single-crystal silicon layers of thicknesses 20 and 100 nm at temperatures between 30 and 450 K are measured using joule heating and electrical-resistance thermometry in suspended microfabricated structures. In general, a large reduction in thermal conductivity resulting from phonon-boundary scattering is observed. Thermal conductivity of the 20 nm thick silicon layer at room temperature is nearly 22 W m-1 K-1, compared to the bulk value, 148 W m-1 K-1. The predictions of the classical thermal conductivity theory that accounts for the reduced phonon mean free paths based on a solution of the Boltzmann transport equation along a layer agrees well with the experimental results.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene, both because of its rich physics and its high mobility. However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors. Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films or requires high voltages. Although single layers of MoS(2) have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) range are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS(2) mobility of at least 200 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 × 10(8) and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS(2) has a direct bandgap, it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS(2) could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.},

abstract = {As a new two-dimensional (2D) material, phosphorene has drawn growing attention owing to its novel electronic properties, such as layer-dependent direct bandgaps and high carrier mobility. Herein we investigate the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities of single- and multi-layer phosphorene, focusing on geometrical (sample size, orientation and layer number) and strain (compression and tension) effects. A strong anisotropy is found in the in-plane thermal conductivity with its value along the zigzag direction being much higher than that along the armchair direction. Interestingly, the in-plane thermal conductivity of multi-layer phosphorene is insensitive to the layer number, which is in strong contrast to that of graphene where the interlayer interactions strongly influence the thermal transport. Surprisingly, tensile strain leads to an anomalous increase in the in-plane thermal conductivity of phosphorene, in particular in the armchair direction. Both the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities can be modulated by external strain; however, the strain modulation along the cross-plane direction is more effective and thus more tunable than that along the in-plane direction. Our findings here are of great importance for the thermal management in phosphorene-based nanoelectronic devices and for thermoelectric applications of phosphorene.},

Dominant contributions to kappa(L) from out-of-plane or flexural phonons are found, which is consistent with previous findings for single-layer graphene (SLG). However, the interaction between graphene layers in MLG and graphite breaks a selection rule on phonon-phonon scattering, causing their kappa(L)s to be much lower than that of SLG. C(13) isotopes are shown to be an important scattering mechanism, accounting for an similar to 15{\%} additional drop in the kappa(L) of these systems. We demonstrate that the kappa(L) values converge to that of graphite after only about five layers, a consequence of weak interlayer coupling.

The thermal transport behavior of these heterostructures plays a pivotal role in determining their functional performance. This work studies the thermal transport in a GE-MoS2 bilayer heterostructure via molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the in-plane thermal conductivity lambda(B) of the GE-MoS2 bilayer can be approximated by that of an isolated monolayer GE. The lB of an infinitely long GE-MoS2 bilayer is calculated to be 1037 W m(-1) K-1, while its out-of-plane interface thermal conductance G is obtained as 5.81 MW m(-2) K-1. The increase in the interface coupling strengths can dramatically increase G but has little effect on lB. On the other hand, G also increases with temperature because of the enhanced phonon coupling between GE and MoS2. This study is helpful for understanding the interface thermal transport behaviors of novel van der Waals heterostructures and could provide guidance for optimal design and control of their thermal properties.},

Unfortunately, no available interatomic potential can precisely characterize the unique features of silicene. Here, we optimized the Stillinger-Weber potential parameters specifically for a single-layer Si sheet, which can accurately reproduce the low buckling structure of silicene and the full phonon dispersion curves obtained from ab initio calculations. By performing equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations with the new potential, we reveal that the three methods consistently yield an extremely low thermal conductivity of silicene and a short phonon mean-free path, suggesting silicene as a potential candidate for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Moreover, by qualifying the relative contributions of lattice vibrations in different directions, we found that the longitudinal phonon modes dominate the thermal transport in silicene, which is fundamentally different from graphene, despite the similarity of their two-dimensional honeycomb lattices.},

abstract = {We report on the total-energy electronic-structure calculations on the basis of the density-functional theory that clarify atomic and electronic structures of the silicene on the Ag(111), the hexagonal BN, and the hydrogen-processed Si(111) surfaces. On the Ag(111) surfaces which are most commonly used as substrates for the silicene in current experiments, we find several stable and metastable structures with the 4×4, √13×√13, and 2√3×2√3 periodicities with respect to the 1×1 Ag(111) lateral cell within the total-energy difference of 70 meV per Si atom. Those stable structures show the excellent agreement with the scanning tunneling microscopy measurement in their structural characteristics. The metastable structures with comparable total energies await experimental observations. In all the stable and metastable structures, the silicene is buckled substantially so that the $\pi$ state rehybridizes with the $\sigma$ state, leading to the $\pi$+ state, and then the linear energy dispersion peculiar to the Dirac electrons disappears in several cases associated with the opening of the energy gap. Moreover, we find that the substantial mixing of the $\pi$+ state, generated in such a way, with the states of the Ag atoms in the substrate converts the $\pi$+ state to the mixed $\pi$+ state and thus makes the state shift downwards or upwards, eventually annihilating Dirac electrons near the Fermi level. The absence of Dirac electrons caused in this way is found to be common to all the stable and metastable structures of the silicene on the Ag(111) substrates. We also find that the interaction between the $\pi$+ and the substrate orbitals should be weak enough to preserve Dirac electrons and at the same time be sizable to keep the system stable. We then propose two specific substrates as good candidates for the silicene with Dirac electrons, i.e., hexagonal BN and the hydrogen-processed Si(111) surface. We clarify that the silicene on those substrates are stable enough with the binding energy comparable to or twice that of the graphite and preserve Dirac electrons near the Fermi level.},

abstract = {Approximately 90 per cent of the world's power is generated by heat engines that use fossil fuel combustion as a heat source and typically operate at 30-40 per cent efficiency, such that roughly 15 terawatts of heat is lost to the environment. Thermoelectric modules could potentially convert part of this low-grade waste heat to electricity. Their efficiency depends on the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of their material components, which is a function of the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and absolute temperature. Over the past five decades it has been challenging to increase ZT {\textgreater} 1, since the parameters of ZT are generally interdependent. While nanostructured thermoelectric materials can increase ZT {\textgreater} 1 (refs 2-4), the materials (Bi, Te, Pb, Sb, and Ag) and processes used are not often easy to scale to practically useful dimensions. Here we report the electrochemical synthesis of large-area, wafer-scale arrays of rough Si nanowires that are 20-300 nm in diameter. These nanowires have Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity values that are the same as doped bulk Si, but those with diameters of about 50 nm exhibit 100-fold reduction in thermal conductivity, yielding ZT = 0.6 at room temperature. For such nanowires, the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity approaches the amorphous limit for Si, which cannot be explained by current theories. Although bulk Si is a poor thermoelectric material, by greatly reducing thermal conductivity without much affecting the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, Si nanowire arrays show promise as high-performance, scalable thermoelectric materials.},

Thermoelectrics currently find only niche applications because of their limited efficiency, which is measured by the dimensionless parameter ZT-a function of the Seebeck coefficient or thermoelectric power, and of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Maximizing ZT is challenging because optimizing one physical parameter often adversely affects another. Several groups have achieved significant improvements in ZT through multi-component nanostructured thermoelectrics, such as Bi(2)Te(3)/Sb(2)Te(3) thin-film superlattices, or embedded PbSeTe quantum dot superlattices. Here we report efficient thermoelectric performance from the single-component system of silicon nanowires for cross-sectional areas of 10 nm x 20 nm and 20 nm x 20 nm. By varying the nanowire size and impurity doping levels, ZT values representing an approximately 100-fold improvement over bulk Si are achieved over a broad temperature range, including ZT approximately 1 at 200 K. Independent measurements of the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, combined with theory, indicate that the improved efficiency originates from phonon effects. These results are expected to apply to other classes of semiconductor nanomaterials.},

The results show that the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature and that the presence of the SiO2 substrate results in a great reduction, up to 78{\%} at 300 K, to the thermal conductivity of silicene. With atomic trajectories from equilibrium MD simulations, we perform spectral energy density analysis to compute the thermal conductivities, spectral phonon relaxation times, and spectral phonon mean free paths (MFPs) of freestanding and supported silicene at 300 K. When silicene is put on a SiO2 substrate, the phonon relaxation times are decreased from 1–13 ps to less than 1 ps, and the phonon MFPs are reduced from 10–120 nm to 0–20 nm. We also calculate the thermal conductivity contributions from all phonon branches and find that the thermal conductivities of freestanding and supported silicene are mainly ({\textgreater}85{\%}) contributed by the longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons, while the out-of-plane acoustic phonons have a contribution less than 3{\%}.

At 300 K, the thermal conductivity of monolayer silicene is found to be 9.4 W/mK and much smaller than bulk silicon. The contributions from in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations to thermal conductivity are quantified, and the out-of-plane vibration contributes less than 10{\%} of the overall thermal conductivity, which is different from the results of the similar studies on graphene.

abstract = {Abstract The question of what fraction of the total heat flow is transported by phonons with different mean-free-paths is addressed using a Landauer approach with a full dispersion description of phonons to evaluate the thermal conductivities of bulk and thin film silicon. For bulk Si, the results reproduce those of a recent molecular dynamic treatment showing that about 50{\%} of the heat conduction is carried by phonons with a mean-free-path greater than about 1 $\mu$m. For the in-plane thermal conductivity of thin Si films, we find that about 50{\%} of the heat is carried by phonons with mean-free-paths shorter than in the bulk. When the film thickness is smaller than ∼0.2 $\mu$m, 50{\%} of the heat is carried by phonons with mean-free-paths longer than the film thickness. The cross-plane thermal conductivity of thin-films, where quasi-ballistic phonon transport becomes important, is also examined. For ballistic transport, the results reduce to the well-known Casimir limit [H. B. G. Casimir, Physica 5, 495–500 (1938)]. These results shed light on phonon transport in bulk and thin-film silicon and demonstrate that the Landauer approach provides a relatively simple but accurate technique to treat phonon transport from the ballistic to diffusive regimes.},

Moreover, it is found that isotopic doping is efficient in reducing the thermal conductivity of SiNSs. When SiNSs are randomly doped with 30Si at the doping percentage of 50{\%}, a maximum reduction of about 20{\%} is obtained. This reduction can be increased when the dopants are arranged into a superlattice pattern. The thermal conductivity of these superlattice-structured SiNSs changes non-monotonically as the thickness of their lattice layers decreases.

abstract = {Silicene, the silicon-based counterpart of graphene, has received exceptional attention from a wide community of scientists and engineers in addition to graphene, due to its unique and fascinating physical and chemical properties. Recently, the thermal transport of the atomic thin Si layer, critical to various applications in nanoelectronics, has been studied; however, to date, the substrate effect has not been investigated. In this paper, we present our nonequilibrium molecular dynamics studies on the phonon transport of silicene supported on different substrates. A counter-intuitive phenomenon, in which the thermal conductivity of silicene can be either enhanced or suppressed by changing the surface crystal plane of the substrate, has been observed. This phenomenon is fundamentally different from the general understanding of supported graphene, a representative two-dimensional material, in which the substrate always has a negative effect on the phonon transport of graphene. By performing phonon polarization and spectral energy density analysis, we explain the underlying physics of the new phenomenon in terms of the different impacts on the dominant phonons in the thermal transport of silicene induced by the substrate: the dramatic increase in the thermal conductivity of silicene supported on the 6H-SiC substrate is due to the augmented lifetime of the majority of the acoustic phonons, while the significant decrease in the thermal conductivity of silicene supported on the 3C-SiC substrate results from the reduction in the lifetime of almost the entire phonon spectrum. Our results suggest that, by choosing different substrates, the thermal conductivity of silicene can be largely tuned, which paves the way for manipulating the thermal transport properties of silicene for future emerging applications.},

abstract = {We use a combination of vibrational-mode analysis and molecular-dynamics simulations to study the effect of grain size on the nature of thermal vibrations, their localization, and their ability to carry heat in nanocrystalline silicon. Vibrational-mode analysis demonstrates that the vibrations that carry most of the heat in small-grain (≲3 nm) structurally heterogeneous nanocrystalline silicon are almost identical in nature to those in homogeneous amorphous silicon, where the majority of the vibrations are delocalized and unpolarized. Consequently, the principal thermal conductivity mechanism in such a nanocrystalline material is the same as in the amorphous material. With increasing grain size, the vibrational modes become progressively more like that of a crystalline material; this is reflected in a crossover in the mechanism of thermal transport to that of a crystalline material.},

@article{Li2014,
abstract = {ShengBTE is a software package for computing the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline bulk materials and nanowires with diffusive boundary conditions. It is based on a full iterative solution to the Boltzmann transport equation. Its main inputs are sets of second- and third-order interatomic force constants, which can be calculated using third-party ab-initio packages. Dirac delta distributions arising from conservation of energy are approximated by Gaussian functions. A locally adaptive algorithm is used to determine each process-specific broadening parameter, which renders the method fully parameter free. The code is free software, written in Fortran and parallelized using MPI. A complementary Python script to help compute third-order interatomic force constants from a minimum number of ab-initio calculations, using a real-space finite-difference approach, is also publicly available for download. Here we discuss the design and implementation of both pieces of software and present results for three example systems: Si, InAs and lonsdaleite.
